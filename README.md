# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES (Code Submission Evaluation System) Problem Set, a collection of competitive programming practice problems.

## About CSES Problem Set
The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic programming problems designed to help programmers improve their skills in algorithms and data structures. The problems range from introductory to advanced level and cover various common algorithmic techniques.

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by problem categories:
```
├── tree_algorithms/
│   ├── subordinates.py - Solution for the "Subordinates" problem
│   └── ...
├── graph_algorithms/
│   └── ...
├── dynamic_programming/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Running the Solutions
Most solutions are written in Python and can be run using:

```python3 path_to_solution_file.py```

Inputs can be provided via stdin as specified in each problem description.

## Contributing
Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative solutions by opening an issue or pull request.
